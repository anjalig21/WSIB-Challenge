# WSIB Innovation Lab Problem Set

## Problem 1: React Fundamentals

#### Phase 1:
Create a React component using a class structure. 
Use this component to display 2 HTML Buttons.
Each button must have a unique background colour.
Clicking a button will change only its background colour.

#### Phase 2:
Create a re-usable button React component using a class structure
Pass props and a function from a parent component in order to define & change
the button colours.

#### Phase 3:
Duplicate the reusable component and convert into the newer React Hooks
structure.


## Problem 2: Logical Understanding
In a programming language of your choice, create a Tic Tac Toe game that can be
played via the command line.
If you have already written a Tic Tac Toe game - please try something more fun and
attempt a simplistic connect 4, where in turn players select a column to “drop” their
piece in.

Rules:
- The game must be playable by 2 players
- The game must only allow legal moves
- If one player wins then the game ends, the winner is declared
- If the board fills up then the game ends in a draw, the result is declared

Optional:
Add in a computer player that makes moves, doesn’t have to be logical or smart
moves, just legal.


## Problem 3: Code Obfuscation
Time to test how badly you can write functional code. The only requirement for this
problem is a working palindrome detector function. Allow for entry of a word and
return true or false whether or not that word is a palindrome. Make this function as
hard to read as possible; weird variables, complex relationships, roundabout
algorithms, let your imagination go wild.

Examples:
- racecar - TRUE
- baseball - FALSE
- rats live on no evil star - TRUE

Things to consider:
- The code must still be functional when executed!
- Programming language does not matter - just include the language used in the comments.
- Whitespace doesn’t count, extraneous spaces and newlines will be removed.
